## About

Re-Lux is a marketplace app where users can sell a wide range of second-hand luxury goods, from designer clothing to high-end tech. It works in a similar way to other marketplace apps in that users can either make an offer on an item (which can then be accepted or rejected by the seller on their profile page) or add the item straight to their bag if they are happy to pay the asking price. 

Users can also rate and review sellers, save items to their favourites, and list their own items for sale. 

You can try it out here: https://re-lux-marketplace.netlify.app/

### Brief


This was a joint project with my colleague Tony Rodriguez on the General Assembly Software Engineering Bootcamp. Our brief was to build a MongoDB/Express/React/Node application with full CRUD that met the following criteria: 

	•	The back-end application is built with Express and Node.
	•	The front-end application is built with React.
	•	MongoDB is used as the database management system.
	•	The back-end and front-end applications implement JWT token-based authentication to sign up, sign in, and sign out users.
	•	Authorization is implemented across the front-end and back-end. Guest users (those not signed in) should not be able to create, update, or delete data in the application or access functionality allowing those actions.
	•	The project has at least two data entities in addition to the User model. At least one entity must have a relationship with the User model.
	•	The project has full CRUD functionality on both the back-end and front-end.
	•	The front-end application does not hold any secret keys. Public APIs that require secret keys must be accessed from the back-end application.
	•	The project is deployed online so that the rest of the world can use it.
